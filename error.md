The error:

```
mysql.connector.errors.InterfaceError: 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on '34.67.229.167:3306'
```

means your Python code **cannot connect to the MySQL instance on GCP**. This usually happens due to **network/firewall or configuration issues**.

---

# **Steps to Fix the Connection Issue**

## **1. Enable Public IP and Authorize Your IP**

* Go to **Google Cloud Console → SQL → Your MySQL Instance**.
* In the **Connections** tab:

  * Ensure the instance has a **Public IP**.
  * Add your **local machine's public IP address** (or `0.0.0.0/0` for testing) under **Authorized networks**.

  **Note:** Use `https://whatismyipaddress.com/` to find your public IP.

---

## **2. Allow MySQL User Access**

* In **Users** tab, ensure the `root` user is allowed to connect from any host (`%`).

  * Alternatively, create a new user with:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'flaskuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON todo_db.* TO 'flaskuser'@'%';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

---

## **3. Check if the MySQL Server is Running**

* From your local machine, test using:

  ```bash
  mysql -h 34.67.229.167 -u root -p
  ```

  If this fails, the issue is with GCP firewall settings or MySQL instance configuration.

---

## **4. Open Port 3306**

* In **VPC Network → Firewall Rules**:

  * Add a rule to **allow TCP:3306** for your IP (or 0.0.0.0/0 for testing).

---

## **5. Use a Cloud SQL Proxy (Recommended for Security)**

Directly exposing MySQL to the internet is risky.
Instead, use **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy**:

```bash
./cloud-sql-proxy --credentials-file=key.json your-project:region:instance
```

Then connect via `localhost:3306` in Python.
